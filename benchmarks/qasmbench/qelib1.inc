// Dummy qelib1.inc for QNS
// In a real scenario, this would contain gate definitions.
// QNS currently has built-in gates, so this can be empty or contain comments.
// But let's add a custom gate definition to test parsing if we supported it.
// For now, just a comment.
// Standard gates: h, x, y, z, cx, etc.
